	<strong>Auto Updates / Version Lock are not enabled in this Web App module:</strong><br>
	<p>WHMCS has a built-in updater, this method of updating WHMCS is preferred and so {{PANEL_BRAND}} will not attempt to update or upgrade WHMCS from the base installed / detected version.<br/>
		Should you choose to upgrade your WHMCS installation from with WHMCS, be sure to enable Write Mode from the fortification drop down menu and set a 30-minute timer to be safe!</p>
